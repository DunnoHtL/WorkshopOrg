# **Workshop Organisation Manual**

This manual gives instructions on how to organise an AAII internal workshop and what to prepare. 

## **A week before the workshop**
||Things to do|check|
|:---:|:---|:---:|
|1|Determine the workshop date and check the meeting room availability. <span style="color:red">**CB02.12.225**</span> is the ideal meeting room for less than 30 attendees.|&#x2610;|
|2|Send <span style="color:red">**Outlook invitations with location and time information**</span> to the attendees.|&#x2610;|
|3|Work with the speakers/facilitators to develop a detailed agenda for the workshop. The things to be decided include but are not limited to **everyone's presenting content (slides or PDF), way (remote or in-person), session/time arrangement and host/session chair appointment**. An agenda template is given in Supplementary Table 1.|&#x2610;|
|4|Collect the presenters' slides and PDFs.|&#x2610;|

## **1-2 days before the workshop**
||Things to do|check|
|:---:|:---|:---:|
|1|Print out the agenda; Check with Prof Lu whether to print out all the slides/PDFs.|&#x2610;|
|2|Test the **microphone, speaker, wireless presentation pointer (NA for CB02.12.225), and projector functionalities**. If the workshop is going to use the audio/speaker system of the meeting room, **ensure everyone on site in the Zoom meeting is muted**; otherwise, there would be echo interference. Ensure there are enough seats and rearrange the desks and seats if needed.|&#x2610;|
|3|Prepare the camera and tripod for taking the group photo. The usual photography site is the Winter Garden on Level 12, CB02.|&#x2610;|
|4|Purchase **snacks, juice, disposable cups and bottled water for tea break**, and **pre-order lunch**. More details about food ordering are in Supplementary Table 2. <span style="color:red">**Ensure you ask for the receipts and keep them for reimbursement use**</span>. |&#x2610;|
|5|Allocate people for picking up the lunch on the workshop day.|&#x2610;|

## **On the day of the workshop**
||Things to do|check|
|:---:|:---|:---:|
|1|Place the bottled water and tea break snacks in advance.|&#x2610;|
|2|Check with Prof Lu to give location guidance to the visitors (if we have any).|&#x2610;|
|3|When the workshop begins, ensure everyone on site in the Zoom meeting is muted.|&#x2610;|
|4|If the workshop is a mixed type (remote and in-person), ensure that you share the Zoom link with everyone in advance, and **assign presenters permission to share their screens.**|&#x2610;|
|5|Ensure all presentations are given in the full-screen mode **(press F5 for slides or Win+L for PDF readers.)**|&#x2610;|
|5|Allocate 3-5 people to clean up the meeting room and restore the position of desks and chairs.|&#x2610;|

## **After the workshop**
Reimbursement: Access the Concur system (http://concur.uts.edu.au/) and start a claim. Ensure that you have the correct project code (ask Prof Lu or our centre administrator if you do not know it). The tea break and lunch expense type is *Morning Afternoon Teas/Light Lunches at UTS (Exc alcohol)*.
